# IPMMAP
python wrapper class with mmap for simple and safe IPC

# Description
IPMMAP is a fully parallel IPC(interprocess communication) facility, with exclusion capabilities, based on the [mmap object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html) provided by The Python Standard Library.

This library provides:
* Shared memory access classes provided per permission (manage, edit, read)
* Read-write exclusivity (using [fasteners](https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners))
* class-based and inheritable shared data structures using [ctypes.structure](https://docs.python.org/ja/3/library/ctypes.html)
